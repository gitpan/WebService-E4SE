WebService-E4SE

Epicor's http://www.epicor.com/Products/Pages/E4SE.aspx E4SE software
uses a clunky, IE-only interface (just try to fill in your timesheet with
a non-windows machine!  I dare ya!).

Each action on the software calls a SOAP-based web service API method.
However, the APIs are not neatly packaged in one place (a la Salesforce, etc.).
Also, there aren't any sessions. So, each call to the API must send username 
and password credentials all over again (using NTLM).

There are more than 100 web service files you could work with (.asmx extensions)
each having their own set of methods.  Some of these are grouped somewhat logically,
some are not.  On your installation of E4SE, you can get a listing of method calls
available by visiting one of those files directly (http://epicor/e4se/Resource.asmx
for example).

The purpose of this module is to somewhat abstract out the tedium of dealing with
all of this stuff.

The module will grab the WSDL from the file you're trying to deal with.  It will make
use of that WSDL with XML::Compile::WSDL11.  You can force a reload of the WSDL at any
time.  So, we build the XML::Compile::WSDL11 object and hold onto it for any further
calls to that file.  These are generated by the calls you make, so hopefully we don't
kill you with too many objects.  You can work directly with the new XML::Compile::WSDL11
object if you like, or use the abstracted out methods provided.
